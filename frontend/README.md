# Frontend for New York Diner application

## Project Overview

Enhance a previous frontend project and convert it into a full stack application.

### Specification

The original website sources its data from a JSON file but now, a new Postgresql Database
will be integrated, along with other authentication features.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, this repository will try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript added to it.
